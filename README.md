# Computational Economics

---

## General

All the course material is written inside notebooks and markdown files (usually in `slides/`). Tutorial files (in `tutorial/`) are meant to be run and filled by students.
Slides are available [online](http://www.mosphere.fr/eco309/slides/). (PRs are welcome)
- [introduction](http://www.mosphere.fr/eco309/slides/)
- [convergence](http://www.mosphere.fr/eco309/slides/convergence.html)
- [optimization](http://www.mosphere.fr/eco309/slides/optimization.html)
- [discrete dynamic programming](http://www.mosphere.fr/eco309/slides/ddp.html)
- [perturbation](http://www.mosphere.fr/eco309/slides/perturbation.html)

Each student is expected to have a clone of the course repository and update it at the beginning of each session. It is suggested to work on a copy of each file.

During the course, each student will be asked to choose and present one Julia library.

The tutorial in the last session will be the final exam.

## Roadmap

Each session is 4 hours, and is expected to be evenly but not contiguously divided between lectures and hands-on tutorials.
