# Computational Economics

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/albop/eco309.git/master?urlpath=lab)

## General

All the course material is written inside notebooks `notebooks/*` and markdown files (usually in `slides/`). Those ending with `_tutorial` are meant to be run and filled by students.
Slides are available [online](http://www.mosphere.fr/eco309/slides). (PRs are welcome)

Each student is expected to have a clone of the course repository and update it at the beginning of each session. It is suggested to work on a copy of each file.

During the course, each student will be asked to choose and present one Julia library.

The tutorial in the last session will be the final exam.

## Setup requirement

- To make the most of the course, it is recommended to install
  - Julia 1.5
  - A good text editor (strongly advised: Visual Studio Code)
  - Git
- As a plan B, it is possible to use the mybinder link above
  - be sure to save your work locally

## Roadmap

Each session is 4 hours, and is expected to be evenly but not contiguously divided between lectures and hands-on tutorials.
